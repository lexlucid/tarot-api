# Tarot API  

A modern take on tarot readings, this API provides programmatic access to pull cards, create spreads, and retrieve detailed card information. Whether you’re building a bot, a web app, or just exploring tarot through code, this API offers an intuitive and scalable way to integrate tarot into your projects.

## How It's Made  

**Tech used:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Supabase

This project is built with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and ease of use:  
- **Node.js & Express** power the backend, ensuring fast and reliable endpoints for various tarot queries.  
- **PostgreSQL** stores the card data, including meanings, imagery, and metadata, in a way that’s efficient and easily queryable.  
- **Supabase** handles user authentication, making it secure and straightforward to manage users and their interactions with the API.  

Endpoints follow REST principles, allowing developers to pull single cards, create multi-card spreads, or fetch detailed card insights. The API is also structured to be extensible, so new spreads, decks, or features can be added with minimal friction.

## Optimizations  

Throughout development, I focused on performance and maintainability:  
- Optimized database queries to ensure quick response times, even when working with large datasets.  
- Refactored middleware functions for cleaner, reusable code, reducing redundancy and simplifying debugging.  
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for a seamless developer experience.

## Lessons Learned  

This project reinforced the importance of:  
- Designing APIs that are both functional and developer-friendly.  
- Leveraging PostgreSQL’s relational capabilities to manage complex data effectively.  
- Balancing simplicity with scalability, ensuring the API can grow alongside future needs.  

It also reminded me how much I enjoy blending creativity and technical problem-solving—whether it’s designing tarot card spreads or optimizing API endpoints.
